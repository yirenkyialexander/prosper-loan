# A Prosper Loan Data Exploration Project

## by Alexander Yirenkyi


## Dataset

This data set contains 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan, including loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status, borrower income, and many others. In this project, the analysis will be structured to provide simple univariate relationships to multivariate relationships; the study will address questions like whether or not the monthly loan payment has a correlation to the loan original amount, what is the term of the loan in terms of loan status, identifying the frequency of the categorical variables, such as loan term, borrower's employment status, year of loan, and loan status, are there differences between individual loans depending on how large the original loan amount was?

## Summary of Findings

The loan origination date column was first converted from object datatype to datetime during the data cleaning process. Next, the year was extracted from the datetime before setting the data type of the extracted year column as categorical variable. Additionally, the loan term values were transformed from the original values of 12 months, 36 months, and 60 months to short term, medium term, and long term. There are values in the loan status that represent past due in several categories of days; these values have been replaced with a single value called "past due" that applies regardless of how many days have passed. The lending state. There are values in the loan status that represent past due in several categories of days; these values have been replaced with a single value called "past due" that applies regardless of how many days have passed. The stated monthly income and monthly loan payment variables, which were converted from float to integer for compatibility with the loan amount data type, were not left out of the transformation of the borrower state values from state abbreviation to full text. The object data type of the occupation column was changed to a categorical data type. Because there are 81 features, the variables that are important for this study were combined into a new dataframe and saved as comma-separated values to be referenced.

In the distribution of prior findings, the income verifiable variable has the true value as the largest occurrence, and the spread over the loan status category for the present loan status may be calculated as follows: 52434 have true (verifiable income), while 4142 have false (no verifiable income). There are 1857 borrowers with verified income and 210 borrowers without verifiable income in the past-due category. Borrowers with verified income make up 35292 of the completed loan status category while 2792 do not. According to past studies, the medium term appears to have the largest frequency of loan length in the distribution; the current loan status shows that 20127 loans were classified as long-term, 36387 as medium-term, and only 62 as short-term. There are 684 long-term dues, 1373 medium-term dues, and 10 short-term dues in the past-due category.According to past studies, the true and false values for the home ownership variable are evenly distributed. The distribution across the loan status category for the current loan status can be calculated as follows: 30478 were true (home owner), whereas 26098 were false (no home ownership). The distribution of house ownership in the past-due category is 1003 homes and 1064 no homes. Home ownership is represented by 18280 in the category of loans that have been paid off, whereas 19794 do not. Since the two variables are positively correlated, as the initial loan amount rises, so do the monthly loan payments.The data points are spread across a scatterplot categorised by term of loan, year, verifiable income, home ownership, loan status, and employment status plotted on different scatterplots to better depict the spread. Previous research has shown that there is a positive relationship between the loan original amount and monthly loan payment. We can also infer from the results that continuous numerical variables are correlated. Using the heatmap, we can see that the original loan amount and monthly loan payment have a positive correlation with a correlation coefficient of 0.93, whereas the stated monthly income and the original loan amount appear to be unrelated.

## Key Insights for Presentation

The distribution of the loan's initial amount is symmetrical and right-skewed. The majority of the loan's initial amount is grouped on the histogram's left side. The original loan amount peaks at around $5,000, there are outliers in the ranges of $32,000 to $35,000, the data runs from roughly $1,000 to $3500, and the monthly loan payment data is likewise right-skewed, an example of symmetrical distribution. On the left side of the histogram, the majority of the monthly loan payments are grouped.The original loan amount reaches its peak at around 173, and the data ranges from roughly zero to 2251 dollars. With 87778 loans disbursed over the medium term, which in this case is 36 months, the majority of loans are disbursed, accounting for about 77 percent of the total loan term duration. The remaining 23 percent of loans are distributed among the long term (60 months) and short term (12 months) loan durations. With a count of 69557, those who are employed have the largest occurrence in the job status category, while those who are retired have the lowest occurrence. As a result, the working class is more likely to get money than the retired population.The most loan disbursements occurred in the year 2013 (34345), followed by 2012 and 2014, which came in second and third, respectively. The fewest loan disbursements occurred in the year 2005, which saw 22 disbursements. The loan status data distribution further shows that few borrowers cancelled their loans and that the majority of borrowers had current and serviceable loans. Of those who have current and serviceable loans, 10% of borrowers defaulted on their loan payments. Borrowers who are behind on their payments have one or more due dates.Borrowers who are behind on their payments have one or more due dates. The distribution of the loan's initial amount is displayed on a box to show the rightward skewness, and outliers are denoted by asterisks in the whiskers. The loan initial amount variable's 25th percentile is just below $5,000, the median is slightly above $5,000, and the 75th percentile is just shy of the $15,000 mark.
